This Java code represents a Minesweeper game implemented using the World class. It includes a Game class that manages the grid, mines, game state, and user interactions through keyboard and mouse
events. The Tile class represents individual cells, handling mine placement, neighbor detection, flagging, and recursive filling. The game supports a visual display of the grid, with feedback for
wins, losses, and dynamic mine counts. The design allows for customizable grid sizes, mine counts, and user-defined difficulty levels, integrating reset and start functionalities triggered by
keyboard inputs.
